Event-B models in LaTeX.

The package is already pre-compiled. However, in the case where it is
needed for recompiling, a Makefile has been provided. The users
can simply issue the following command:

  make

This will perform the following:

- To create the documentation "eventB.pdf"
- To create the sample file "sample-eventB.pdf"

The style file "eventB.style" should be copied to some proper location

"/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/eventB.sty").
